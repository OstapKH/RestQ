# RESTQ - Web Applications Benchmarking and Energy Monitoring Framework

RESTQ is a comprehensive framework for benchmarking web applications and monitoring their energy consumption. It provides automated tools for performance testing, energy analysis, and result visualization across different database systems and configurations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Energy Monitoring**: Real-time energy consumption tracking using PowerAPI, Scaphandre and PowerJoular.
- **Benchmarking with TPC Standards**: Support for TPC-C and TPC-H implementations to evaluate performance under realistic workloads.
- **REST API**: HTTP API for remote benchmark execution and monitoring
- **Ansible Automation**: Automated deployment and configuration management
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for benchmark results and energy metrics
- **Multi-Database Support**: Currently supports PostgreSQL; integration with additional DBMSs is underway.
